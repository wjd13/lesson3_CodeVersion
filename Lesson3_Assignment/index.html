                <span class="text-muted">Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Also referred to as Revision Control or Souce Control Management, Version Control is the use of one main repository for all project files that are being udpdated as time goes on and/or by group members working on the same thing. Thus, a version control system (VCS) notices who changes files, what was changed, and when files were changed - then merges all changes to a file. Benefits of the VCS include revision to older versions of files, simultaneous editing from different users,and files are all held in a common repository so they cannot be overwritten. Repositories are either local, belonging to an individual user, or remote, where multiple users share access on a server. A popular distributed VCS, and the remote depository for this class, uses GIT. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #2
                <span class="text-muted">Git[Hub]</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As mentioned in Highlight #1, Git is a distributed version control system, and it is free and open source, popular for its ease of use to handling projects big nd small. GitHub, what we are using for this class, allows for free local branchin, convenient staging, and fast work perfomance.  Git is useful in that every user has access to the full repository from their computer, processes tend to run faster, and that there is no unintentional overwriting of files (and thus no one point of failure).Git utilizes commands that help users visualize, move between remoteand local repositories, save and monitor their individual and collective progress. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Using Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To use git, one must know what and when to use git commands in their workspace terminal. All commands start with git followed by whattever action you wish to perform. Common commands are "init" - to initialize, "status" - to display the status of the repository, or "pull" to fetch and merge. The three main, basic steps for moving files are as follows; git add to designating you are adding files to the repository, git commit to put the files up for staging and also lets a string of characters describe the update, and git push to push the files to the remote reposity (in the cse for this class assignments). There are several other git commands that aid in the users  moving files between the VCS, such as "git log" or "git clone", however emphasis remains on add, commit, and push.  </p>
